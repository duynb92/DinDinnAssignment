# DinDinnAssignment
This repository used for assignment tests from DinDinn. The main goal of this task is replicate UI and animation from this beautiful snippet [TastyBurger](https://dribbble.com/shots/4038053-Tasty-Burger-App), and due to limitation of time, I did not spend too much on application structure and data management.
